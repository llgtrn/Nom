# 16 — `.nomx` syntax gap backlog

**Date:** 2026-04-14
**Purpose:** Dedicated home for the growing list of `.nomx` v1/v2 syntax gaps surfaced by the Accelworld/upstreams translation corpus (doc 14). Split off from doc 14 once the gap list crossed the 20-item threshold. Every gap routes to one of three destinations:

- **W-wedge** — a concrete strictness-lane wedge in doc 13 §5
- **authoring-guide entry** — a convention/idiom note for the authoring docs
- **design deferred** — an open question to revisit when blocking work lands

> **Status 2026-04-14:** 35 gaps enumerated from doc 14 translations #1-12; no destination closures yet this cycle. Each cycle's gap-additions append here and get triaged into one of the three destinations. A gap is "closed" once either (a) its wedge ships with a test, (b) its authoring-guide note is written, or (c) its deferred status is pinned with a blocker.

## Wedge master index (for cross-ref with doc 13)

- **W4 (strictness lane, 6 sub-wedges A1-A6):** A1 ✅ A2 ✅ A3-A6 ⏳ — see doc 13 §5.
- **W5:** Format-string interpolation grammar.
- **W6:** Literal-string constants (Python-`Literal`-style).
- **W9:** `fail with "..."` expression grammar (subsumes W-short-circuit-fail).
- **W10:** `is-a` runtime type probes.
- **W11:** Enum / sum-type declarations.
- **W12:** Receiver-form methods.
- **W13:** Entry-point `main` special-case.
- **W14:** Exit-code vocabulary.
- **W15:** Interpreter/shebang metadata clause.
- **W16:** Environment-variable access vocabulary.
- **W17:** Nested-record-path syntax (TOML dot-paths).
- **W18:** `@Union` typed-kind for sum-types (replaces earlier ambiguous "W5" reference).
- **W38:** Wire-field-tag clause (`at field N` / `at tag N` for proto3, CBOR, Avro, Cap'n Proto — per-field stable numeric IDs).
- **W39:** Pattern-shape clause on data decls (regex-as-prose: closed 8-10-word vocabulary for character-classes, quantifiers, anchoring, case-folding, alternation).
- **W40:** Exhaustiveness-check over `when` clauses on enum-valued data — totality gate for state-machine transitions and any `when current is X` branching on a closed set. Ties into W30 + existing MECE validator.
- **W41:** `property` top-level kind declaration — expands closed kind set from 7 to 8 nouns. Universally-quantified claim over a generator; orthogonal to function/data/concept.
- **W42:** Generator-shape clause — closed-vocabulary domain-range descriptors for property input generators (`list lengths from N to M`, `integers from -X to Y`, `text of shape …`). Reuses W39 pattern-shape vocabulary.
- **W43:** Retry-policy clause — small-vocabulary orchestrator directive: `up to N times with delay D, backoff linear|exponential|constant`. Attaches to composition or individual function decl; orchestrator honors the declaration at build-time.
- **W44:** Watermark clause — `watermark the stream at FIELD with an N-UNIT allowed lateness` for event-time correctness on streaming sources. Closed vocabulary for late-arrival policies.
- **W45:** Window-aggregation clause — `window of D over FIELD` with closed kinds `tumbling`/`sliding`/`session`/`global`. Pairs with W40 exhaustiveness-check for per-window totality. Core stream-processing primitive.
- **W46:** `scenario` top-level kind declaration — expands closed kind set 8→9 nouns (8th was W41 `property`). Asserted-behavior claim: named precondition/action/postcondition triple. Covers Gherkin, RSpec behavior blocks, Playwright test descriptions. Orthogonal to function/data/concept/property.
- **W47:** Scenario-clause grammar — closed 3-keyword set `given`/`when`/`then`; each clause is a prose sentence. Ships paired with W46. Keyword repeats on every clause (no `and`-continuation).
- **W48:** Clock-domain clause — `at every rising edge of CLOCK` / `at every falling edge of CLOCK` attaches to synchronous-logic function decls. Expresses temporal contracts without adding a new kind; sits alongside `requires`/`ensures`. Narrow closed vocabulary.
- **W49:** Quantifier-vocabulary lock — reserve `every`/`no`/`some`/`at-least N`/`at-most N`/`exactly N` as quantifier tokens inside `requires`/`ensures` clauses. Retroactive payoff wedge: disambiguates ensure-clause parsing across 15+ prior paradigm translations (Prolog/SQL-CTE/Rego/Hypothesis/property-tests/…).
- **W50:** `@Route` typed-slot kind — narrow extension to the @Kind vocabulary (currently `@Function`/`@Data`/`@Module`/`@Concept`/`@Composition`) for HTTP method+path routes, gRPC methods, event handlers, CLI subcommands. Uses the existing typed-slot resolver; `@Route matching "GET /todos"` syntax. Small wedge, broadly applicable.
- **W51:** QualityName-registration formalization wedge — **UNBLOCKED 2026-04-14** by reaching the 10-seed threshold via Idris 2 translation (#73, `totality` seed). Formalizes the QualityName registry surface (doc 08 §8 + MEMORY.md roadmap item 8): registered axes with metric functions, cardinality constraints (`exactly_one_per_app` etc.), MECE-validator participation. Seeds to bake: forward_compatibility / numerical_stability / gas_efficiency / synthesizability / minimum_cost / statistical_rigor / availability / auditability / accessibility / totality. Ships the `nom corpus register-axis` CLI per MEMORY.md roadmap item 8 + extends M7a required-axes registry (nom-dict commit `bcadcb3`).

Existing lanes not duplicated here: W7 placeholder rows (doc 15 §2); W8 100-repo harness (doc 15 §3-§7).

**Adding a gap:**

1. Translate a function in doc 14; note the gap in the translation's "Gaps surfaced" section.
2. Append a row here with a destination pick.
3. If the destination is a new W-wedge, reserve the next W-number and cross-reference doc 13.

**Closing a gap:**

1. Wedge: ship the commit, update Status to ✅, link the commit hash.
2. Authoring-guide: write the entry, update Status to ✅, link the entry.
3. Deferred: pin the blocker reason, update Status to 🔒, note when to revisit.

**Review cadence:** every five new gaps, re-read the 🧠 design-deferred rows to see whether any blocker lifted.
